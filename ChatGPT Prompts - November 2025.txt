I have a question about assigning SAS libraries. Instead of writing out the full path to a library, such as libname HHS "/export/viya/homes/lincoln.groves@sas.com/HHS_OTJ", how can I use a ~ to shorten the path?

But, you can use the ~ in SAS Viya for Learners. Can you explain to me how it works?

I’d now like to write some SAS code that will help me download a .CSV file from a GitHub page. The data file is found here: https://github.com/lincolngroves/SAS-OTJ-HHS/blob/main/CPS_2015_2023_ltd.csv. Can you please help me write this code so I can load the data into SAS Studio?

I'd like to better understand my new SAS data set HHS.HHS_OTJ_Raw. Can you help me write some SAS code which summarizes all the numeric and non-numeric variables in the dataset? Bonus points for graphs - and thanks!

I’m a beginning SAS user and that code got much too complex. And it’s giving me the following errors: 
ERROR: Expected %DO not found.
ERROR: Skipping to next %END statement.
Can you please simplify?


I’m struggling to understand some complex proc SQL code in SAS. Allegedly, this code takes a very long data set and collapses the data to a much small number of observations, while creating a bunch of new variables. Can you help explain it to me like I’m a 10 year old? Here is the code:
 
********************************************************  By State ;
proc sql;
	create 	table hhs.covid_labor_supply as 
	select	distinct state_fip, state_name, 
            year(yearquarter) as Year format 9.,
			
/*******************************************************************  Labor Force Status | All  */
			sum( ( unemp=1 ) * WTFINL ) 											/ sum( ( in_LF=1 ) *   	WTFINL )									as UE_Women				label="Unemployment Rate"	format percent9.1 		,
			sum( ( in_LF=1 ) * WTFINL ) 											/ sum(  				WTFINL )									as LFP_Women			label="LFP Rate"			format percent9.1 		,


/*******************************************************************  Labor Force Status | By Education  */

			/*******************************************************  Unemployment */
			sum( ( educ_ltd="High School Diploma" ) * ( unemp=1 ) * WTFINL ) 		/ sum( ( educ_ltd="High School Diploma" ) * ( in_LF=1 ) * WTFINL )	as UE_Women_HS			label="EDUC <= HS" 		format percent9.1 		,
			sum( ( educ_ltd="Some College" ) * ( unemp=1 ) * WTFINL ) 				/ sum( ( educ_ltd="Some College" ) * ( in_LF=1 ) * WTFINL ) 		as UE_Women_SCollege	label="Some College"	format percent9.1 		,
			sum( ( educ_ltd="College +" ) * ( unemp=1 ) * WTFINL ) 					/ sum( ( educ_ltd="College +" ) * ( in_LF=1 ) * WTFINL ) 			as UE_Women_CollegeP	label="College +" 		format percent9.1 		,

			/*******************************************************  LFP */
			sum( ( educ_ltd="High School Diploma" ) * ( in_LF=1 ) * WTFINL ) 		/ sum( ( educ_ltd="High School Diploma" ) * WTFINL ) 				as LFP_Women_HS			label="EDUC <= HS" 		format percent9.1 		,
			sum( ( educ_ltd="Some College" ) * ( in_LF=1 ) * WTFINL ) 				/ sum( ( educ_ltd="Some College" ) * WTFINL ) 						as LFP_Women_SCollege	label="Some College" 	format percent9.1 		,
			sum( ( educ_ltd="College +" ) * ( in_LF=1 ) * WTFINL ) 					/ sum( ( educ_ltd="College +" ) * WTFINL ) 							as LFP_Women_CollegeP	label="College +" 		format percent9.1 		,


/*******************************************************************  Labor Force Status | By Child Status  */

			/*******************************************************  Unemployment */
			sum( ( child_status="No Children" ) * ( unemp=1 ) * WTFINL ) 			/ sum( ( child_status="No Children" ) * ( in_LF=1 ) * WTFINL ) 		as UE_Women_NoKids		label="No Children" 	format percent9.1 		,
			sum( ( child_status="Older Children" ) * ( unemp=1 ) * WTFINL ) 		/ sum( ( child_status="Older Children" ) * ( in_LF=1 ) * WTFINL ) 	as UE_Women_OlderKids	label="Older Children" 	format percent9.1 		,
			sum( ( child_status="Child < 5" ) * ( unemp=1 ) * WTFINL ) 				/ sum( ( child_status="Child < 5" ) * ( in_LF=1 ) * WTFINL ) 		as UE_Women_YoungKids	label="Young Children"	format percent9.1 		,

			/*******************************************************  LFP */
			sum( ( child_status="No Children" ) * ( in_LF=1 ) * WTFINL ) 			/ sum( ( child_status="No Children" ) * WTFINL ) 					as LFP_Women_NoKids		label="No Children" 	format percent9.1 		,
			sum( ( child_status="Older Children" ) * ( in_LF=1 ) * WTFINL ) 		/ sum( ( child_status="Older Children" ) * WTFINL ) 				as LFP_Women_OlderKids	label="Older Children" 	format percent9.1 		,

	from 	hhs.hhs_otj_raw

	order	by 1,2,3 ;

Can you please create some SAS code that creates a nice summary table of the new variables in the hhs.covid_labor_supply data set?

Alright, one more trick. Can you please help me write some SAS code that will use the hhs.covid_labor_supply data set and examine UE_Women, UE_Women_NoKids, UE_Women_OlderKids, and UE_Women_YoungKids by state over time? The time variable is year and the state variable is named state_name. Thank you!

The heatmap syntax gives me this error:
title "Unemployment Rate (All Women) by State and Year";
proc sgplot data=HHS.COVID_LABOR_SUPPLY;
heatmap x=year y=state_name / colorresponse=UE_Women colormodel=(white orange red);
gradlegend label="Unemployment Rate";
                  -----
                  22
                  202
ERROR 22-322: Syntax error, expecting one of the following: a quoted string, ;, /.  
ERROR 202-322: The option or parameter is not recognized and will be ignored.


Alright, one final trick. The “Unemployment Trends for Women by State (Overall and by Child Status)” plot is overwhelming.  Can you create a series of plots, by state, which show the four time series by child status?  Thanks!


Alright, one more request.  Can you add some details in SAS comments to this code, so I can better understand it 6 months from now? 
[ insert the code from your program ]
